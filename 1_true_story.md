[Verse 1]
Got my first guitar when I turned 13
'Kumbaya' was all that I could sing
Learned alone in my room when parents left the house

I thought corporations were evil
That they made us less than we are
Then became a cog for that which I disagree

Used to think that some were lucky (yeah), I always lost
Put my finger on the reason now, I had it wrong
Cuz' when all you got is a hammer, everything’s a nail

Used to believe that I was average (yeah), another kid
From the suburbs of the south just doing my thing
Until I moved to New York, skipped to California,
Flew around the world, met a beautiful girl

[Verse 2]
Taught myself to code at 3am in my chair
make more money in a month than most make in a year
Through the process of growing I faced my fears
Obstacles are illusions now, they disappear

Wrote this song from a loft in New York City
Snow outside all white it’s very pretty
Wouldn’t have this if I didn’t cancel Netflix
Wouldn’t have this if I followed the directions (oh)

Don’t give me money for my music just want you to hear it
SoundCloud makes it really easy for you to steal it
I don’t care about copyright if you can feel it
Just copy it, copy it, copy it right you feel me?

Thought if I could make a hundred thou, I’d be happy
Then I did a few times, but I still feel empty
Throw away… everything
Another day… just to sing

[Verse 3]
Yes I drink, I don’t smoke
Don’t get high, just go broke
Taking risks spite my folk
My career is a joke
Sugar mama, I got me one
No more drama, she’s the one

When I wrote this album, swore I’d write fiction
Truth be told true stories my only diction

[Outro]
We’re watching different movies, on the TV screen
Let me try to show you, what is happening
You were made for greatness, if you don’t believe
Then just listen to my album, while you go to sleep
