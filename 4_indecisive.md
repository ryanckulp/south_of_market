[Chorus]
I said love me
She said maybe
Ever since then
(She) been driving me crazy

[Verse 1]
I met you at the star, met you on the coast
Met you in the city where you moved cuz your boss said so
Heard you got a hell of a job
Bleed crimson red too unstoppable jaw

Said I’d make it, hook or crook
Worst case you’re in the kitchen, cook the books
Bought your name dot com, that belongs to me
When I give it back to ya’ need to change some things

[Chorus]
I said love me
She said maybe
Ever since then
(She) been driving me crazy

[Verse 2]
Saturday, go the mission bar
Hit up 8 burrito carts
Republic Embarcadero
Got hacked by Russian Hill though

Said you’d never date here
Guys were way too lame here
But I cracked the code
In the area code

Standards are a pitiful excuse
For not falling in love with a dude
Worthiness a valid excuse
For not falling in love with you

[Chorus]
I said love me
She said you’re crazy
Ever since then
She’s been my lady

[Verse 3]
She complains ‘bout food I don’t cook
I complain her phone (she) don’t pick up
Seems like we’re both imperfect
Can we call it even?

I like spending, She likes saving
When we gonna build a house and make babies?
Remember that time I hid a bottle
Of 2 buck chuck (in) botanical gardens

You’re so humble I’m a braggart
Watch your backhand girl it keeps me grounded
Cocktail toast your cross to bear
Gym shampoo my favorite hair

(we’ve got) Ross and Chandler in the background
You know i’ll be there for you, I’ll never back down

[Chorus]
I said love me
She said maybe
Ever since then
(She) been driving me crazy

I said love me
She said you’re crazy
Ever since then
She’s been my lady
