[Verse 1]
All of my life
Love's been a game
Kept my options open [baby]
Treated all girls the same

[Verse 2]
She's my garden seed
That was never sown
Don't matter where we travel [baby]
You are my home

[Chorus]
I ain't got no job
Just playin' my song
Hope the word agrees with me
If I crash and burn
I'll have had my turn
Singing in the key of G

[Verse 2]
We don't always get what we deserve
Sometimes we get what we do not deserve
I got her

She's been so good to me
How do I return
The favor of love
Where do I learn

[Chorus]
I ain't got no job
Just playin' my song
Hope the word agrees with me
If I crash and burn
I'll have had my turn
Singing in the key of G

[Verse 3]
Gonna put a ring on it girl
Got me talkin' bout ya
Like my future
Livin' in a terrible world
You're the dream I escape to

[Chorus]
I ain't got no job
Just playin' my song
Hope the word agrees with me
If I crash and burn
I'll have had my turn
Singing in the key of G
